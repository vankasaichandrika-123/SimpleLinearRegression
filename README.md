# 📌 Problem Statement

Organizations often want to estimate an employee's salary based on their years of experience.

In this project, we use **Simple Linear Regression** to learn the relationship between:

### Independent Variable (X)

Experience (Years)

### Dependent Variable (Y)

Salary

After training the model, users can enter experience through a web page and receive the predicted salary instantly.

# 📊 Dataset Information

The dataset contains:

| Feature    | Description                   |
| ---------- | ----------------------------- |
| Experience | Number of years of experience |
| Salary     | Corresponding salary          |

### Dataset Size

* Total Records: 30
* Training Data: 24 Records (80%)
* Testing Data: 6 Records (20%)

# 🤖 Machine Learning Algorithm Used

## Simple Linear Regression

Simple Linear Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm used to find the relationship between:

* One Independent Variable (X)
* One Dependent Variable (Y)

It fits the best straight line through the data points.

---

# 📐 Mathematical Formula

The Simple Linear Regression equation is:

```text
Y = mX + b
```

Where:

* Y = Predicted Value
* X = Input Feature (Experience)
* m = Slope of the Line
* b = Intercept

### Example

```text
Salary = m × Experience + b
```

The algorithm learns the values of m and b during training.

---

# 📈 Model Training Process

### Step 1: Import Required Libraries

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
```

### Step 2: Load Dataset

```python
df = pd.read_csv("salary_data.csv")
```

### Step 3: Split Dataset

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X,
    y,
    test_size=0.2,
    random_state=42
)
```

Training Records = 24

Testing Records = 6

---

### Step 4: Train Model

```python
model = LinearRegression()

model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

The model learns:

* Slope (m)
* Intercept (b)

---

# 📊 Model Performance

## Training Accuracy (R² Score)

```text
96%
```

## Testing Accuracy (R² Score)

```text
90%
```

The model performs well on both training and testing datasets, indicating good generalization.

---

# 📚 Evaluation Metrics

## 1. R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)

R² Score measures how well the regression line fits the data.

### Formula

```text
R² = 1 - (SSres / SStot)
```

Where:

```text
SSres = Σ(yactual - ypredicted)²

SStot = Σ(yactual - ymean)²
```

### Interpretation

| R² Score | Meaning            |
| -------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0      | Perfect Prediction |
| 0.9+     | Excellent Model    |
| 0.8+     | Good Model         |
| 0.5      | Moderate           |
| 0        | Poor Model         |

### Project Result

```text
Training R² = 96%

Testing R² = 90%
```

---

## 2. Mean Squared Error (MSE)

MSE measures the average squared difference between actual and predicted values.

### Formula

```text
MSE = (1/n) Σ(yactual - ypredicted)²
```

### Project Result

```text
Train Loss (MSE) = 150

Test Loss (MSE) = 189
```

Lower MSE indicates better performance.

---

## 3. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

RMSE is the square root of MSE.

### Formula

```text
RMSE = √MSE
```

### Advantages

* Easy to interpret
* Same unit as target variable
* Commonly used in regression problems

Lower RMSE indicates better prediction accuracy.

---

# 🔮 Prediction on New Data

After training the model, predictions can be made on unseen data.

Example:

```python
experience = [[5]]

salary = model.predict(experience)

print(salary)
```

Output:

```text
Predicted Salary
```

The model uses the learned regression equation to estimate the salary.

---

# 💾 Model Serialization Using Pickle

After successful training, the model is saved into a Pickle file.

### Saving Model

```python
import pickle

pickle.dump(model, open("SLR_MODEL.pkl", "wb"))
```

### Loading Model

```python
model = pickle.load(open("model.pkl", "rb"))
```

---

# Why Use Pickle?

### Advantages

✅ Stores trained model permanently

✅ No need to retrain every time

✅ Faster application startup

✅ Easy deployment

✅ Saves computation time

---

# 🌐 Flask Web Application

Flask is a lightweight Python web framework used to build web applications.

In this project Flask acts as a bridge between:

```text

Flask Backend
        ↓
Machine Learning Model
        ↓
Prediction Result
```
